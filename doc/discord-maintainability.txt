We are in quite a bad state with the maintainability of our connection to Discord

First, self bots aren't allowed and the API may change under our feet, and
they can try to prevent it.

We use `discord.py` which has deprecated self bot support in 1.7 and is removing it in 2.0.

This is quite a bad state for us, I am currently applying patches on top of 1.7, however I
will have to eventually somehow replace on top of v2.0. discord.py-self fork seems promising,
I think I can work together with them and allows for good communication.

However there is some community for self bots it seems, and the most real place I found is
r/discord_selfbots. However it seems like many of the community have turned against you,
you can't get help on this in the most popular communication channels like official Discords API
or r/discordapp. Posting a question about self bots on stackoverflow gets you absolutely hated
by morrons trying to mark your issue as a duplicate of an unrelated issue and saying that
"noone will help you here" because it is against the TOS.
